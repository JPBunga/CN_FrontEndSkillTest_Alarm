# CN_FrontEndSkillTest_Alarm
This is the answer to CN FrontEnd skill test-1 (AlarmClock)

Hi Everyone,
This is the basic description of my first project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which is an AlarmClock.
In this application we can set the alarms and it'll ring the tone when it hits the selcted alarm time.

At the very top you can see the name of the AlarmClock as JPB's Alarm Clock, I've named it on my name :)
Below the title, it'll show the real time which is the current time in "Hr:Min:Sec:AM/PM" format

And the very next section is to set the alarm times. I chose select tags to select the desired timings to set the alarms.

I've added two buttons below it: 
>> One is to set the alarms - on clicking this button after setting the required timings for the alarm it'll add that alarm data to the AlarmList in the bottom section.
>> Other is Stop Alarm Tone button, which is to stop the ringing alarm when it hits the alarm timing.

Bottom section:
The very bottom section is the AlarmList section, which will have the list of all the alrams that are set by the user.
I've added a delete button as well for those list items, it'll only show after the alarm is added into the AlarmList.
So that we can delete the alarms which we didn't want.

Some features:
I've added the scroll effect to the alarm view component so that if we add many alarm items it'll give the scroll effect to see the last alarm item as well.

I've designed this mainly based on Desktop first approach and added some flexibility so that it won't shrink beyond 540px.
If the screen size is 540px or below the main view will occupy the 100% of the viewport width else it'll be placed in the center of the viewport.



Thank You !!

JPBunga.
