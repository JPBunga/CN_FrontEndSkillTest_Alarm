# CN_FrontEndSkillTest_Alarm
This is the answer to CN FrontEnd skill test-1 (AlarmClock)

I've created an application which is a simple Alarm Clock.
In this application we can set the alarms and it'll ring the tone when it hits the selcted alarm time.


At the top it'll show the real time.
I've added the Stop Alarm Tone button to stop the alarm tone from ringing continuously.
We can add as many alarms as we want.
